## Overview

This project addresses the task of predicting whether a GitHub Pull Request (PR) will be merged or closed without merging.

The pipeline covers:

• Dataset loading (curated PR data from HuggingFace).

• Feature engineering (text, time, patch statistics, repository metadata).

• Model training with **Logistic Regression.**

• Evaluation and visualization of results.



## Dataset

We use the AIDev dataset hosted on HuggingFace.
Two variants are supported:

• **Curated subset:** includes commit details and review comments.

• **Full dataset:** larger but without commit/review features.

Data paths are configurable in src/config.py


## Features

### Main groups of features:

• **PR text & time:** title length, body length, created hour/weekday.

• **Patch stats:** lines added, lines deleted, files changed, presence of test files.

• **Metadata:** task type, agent.

• **Repository signals:** star count.

## Methodology

**Train/test split:** 80/20 with stratification.

**Preprocessing:** numeric passthrough, categorical encoded with OneHotEncoder.

**Classifier:** Logistic Regression with class balancing.

**Evaluation metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC.

## Results

**Class balance (test split):**

• Merged: ~4,800

• Not merged: ~1,400

**Performance:**

• ROC-AUC: ~0.69

• Accuracy: ~71%

• Precision (merged): 0.86

• Recall (merged): 0.75

**Key findings:**

• PRs containing tests are more likely to be merged.

• Agents such as OpenAI Codex correlate positively with merges.

• Repository popularity (stars) has weak but noticeable influence.


## Reproducibility

• Fixed seed (42) ensures repeatability.

• All outputs are regenerated with one command.

• Results and features are stored in CSVs for transparency.

## Outputs

### Tables - results/tables

• class_balance_full.csv – overall label distribution

• class_balance_train.csv – label distribution in training split

• class_balance_test.csv – label distribution in test split

• test_predictions_logit.csv – model predictions (y_true, y_prob, y_pred)

• logit_feature_importance.csv – feature importance with coefficients, absolute values, and odds ratios

• sample_model_table.csv – a 1,000-row sample of the modeling table used for training

### Figures - results/figs
